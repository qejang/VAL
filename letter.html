        To my Dearest love, Casi,  
        <br>
        Happy Valentine’s Day, my love! Or better yet, Happy Valentine’s month, since the 14th is just around the corner and I want us to celebrate this time together. To mark this month and to greet you the way you deserve, I decided to make this simple website to ask you to be my Valentine. (Kaya ako panay nag cocoding if napansin mo yun). Something I know you have been patiently, and dying at the same time, waiting to hear from me, judging by the earful of things I hear whenever we are together in calls, and opkors IG notes. T-9 😭😭😭

      <h2>Continuing My Love ✨ </h2>
      <p>
With that in mind, will you be my Valentine, my baby?
Well, you are here already, which already tells me the answer is yes. So, thank you for choosing yes my love, and thank you for choosing me and for being my Valentine's every single day that I am with you. I have never once doubted your capabilities to love me for who I truly am, in all my flaws, fears, and uncertainties which is something I am still so-so grateful for. I love you to the moon and back, and I love you so much for who you’ve been in my life.
        <br>
        From the very beginning of my courtship last February 2024 until its very end, I have always found more reasons to love you more and more. Not just because of your guiding and caring presence that has loved me and calmed me kahit bwisit ka na 😭, especially during moments when I felt lost or unsure, but because there is always more of your heart that I get to know and love as time goes on. As days go by, I am still discovering new parts of you, and with every part I come to understand, I find myself loving you more than ever and deeper casi. With you, I feel love will be something that comes naturally to us no matter the difficulties and challenges.

        Forever am I indebted to you and happily stuck with you. Being with you has taught me what it means to love with patience, effort, and sincerity. I will continue choosing you, my baby, again and again.

        Happy Valentine’s Day to my sweetest lil goobert and baby. Whom I will cherish forever and follow. I love you, Casi!
